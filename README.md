## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand restaurant types and customer voting patterns
- Compare online vs offline order preferences
- Analyze rating distributions and cost preferences
- Identify top-rated and most-voted restaurants
- Visualize order mode trends across restaurant categories

---

## 🧠 Key Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and converting rating formats
- **EDA**: Using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for visual insights
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful patterns from categorical columns
- **Pivot Tables & Heatmaps**: For cross-dimensional analysis

## 📊 Sample Insights

| Insight | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| ⭐ Rating Distribution | Most restaurants rated between 3.5 and 4 |
| 🛵 Online Orders | Majority of restaurants do **not** accept online orders |
| 💸 Cost for Couples | ₹300 is the most preferred price point |
| 🏆 Most Voted Restaurant | Identified using `votes.max()` logic |
| 🍽️ Restaurant Type | Dining restaurants dominate the dataset |
| 🔥 Order Mode vs Type | Cafes prefer online orders; dining spots lean offline |
